## Introduction
ZENIT (ZENIT Enabling Natural Interaction Technology) is designed to enable easy use of multimodal communication channels such as body language, spatial behavior, facial expressions, and speech. The system is based on ubiquitous and low-cost hardware, including a smartphone, a stationary robotic arm, an average computer, and a separate camera. ZENIT provides a solid foundation for advancing human-robot interaction studies and can be used as a companion robot for reminders, entertainment, chatting, social activation, and more.

## Features
- **Multimodal Interaction:** Supports body language, spatial behavior, facial expressions, and speech.
- **Low-Cost Hardware:** Utilizes a smartphone, robotic arm, computer, and camera.
- **Open-Source Software:** Incorporates various open-source components.
- **Distributed System Architecture:** Ensures easy replication and adaptability.
- **Responsive User Experience:** Provides fast sensory processing and AI models for interaction.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Robotic Arm:** Elephant Robotics MechArm 270-Pi or similar.
- **Display Device:** Samsung Galaxy A41 or similar smartphone/tablet.
- **Depth Camera:** Microsoft Azure Kinect.
- **Additional Components:**
  - Power Supply
  - Table Clamp
  - Smartphone Car Holder
  - Router
  - Ethernet and USB-C cables
- **Main Computation Unit:** A laptop or desktop computer with at least:
  - Windows 11
  - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H
  - 32GB RAM
  - NVIDIA GeForce 3070 or equivalent

## Software Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Node.js, C#
- **Software Tools and Libraries:**
  - Unity
  - Node.js
  - Python-based AI services
  - Open-source emotion and speech recognition tools

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Snagga86/ZENIT.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Follow the instructions in the `requirements.txt` file for Python dependencies.
   - Install Node.js and required packages using `npm install`.
   - Set up Unity and import necessary assets for the robot face application.

3. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Assemble the robotic arm and attach the smartphone using the car holder.
   - Connect the depth camera and other peripherals as described in the hardware manual.
   - Ensure all devices are connected to the preconfigured router.

## Usage
1. **Starting the System:**
   - Power on the robotic arm, smartphone, and depth camera.
   - Run the main control script to initialize the distributed system.
   - Launch the Unity application on the smartphone to display the robot face.

2. **Interacting with ZENIT:**
   - Use the provided GUI or command-line interface to control the robot.
   - Test different interaction scenarios by modifying the dialog system and behavior rules.

## System Architecture
ZENIT's architecture is divided into three main components:
- **ZENIT Face:** Handles facial expressions and visual output using a smartphone.
- **ZENIT Body:** Controls the movements of the robotic arm.
- **ZENIT Brain:** Manages perception, AI processing, and overall behavior logic.

These components communicate through a network of APIs and protocols, ensuring modularity and ease of extension.
